  <title>Vegas Crypto Narrative</title>
</head>
<body>
  <p>It’s a bright weekend afternoon.<br>
  Short flight.<br>
  All the shades are down.</p>

  <p>The hot desert air creates turbulence as the 737 jolts, then glides toward the runway. The motion wakes me. I look out — nothing. All the shades are still down. The taxi to the gate is almost aggressive.</p>

  <p>It’s like a miracle machine, this plane, jetting me into a parallel space.<br>
  I walk off.<br>
  Vegas.</p>

  <p>I haven’t been here in years. I’m not even sure how I ended up back. Somewhere between nostalgia and a text from an old high school friend offering a pass to the largest Bitcoin conference of the year.</p>

  <p>We haven’t really talked in over a decade. He lived entirely in China until two or three years ago. Now he works for a Chinese ASIC Bitcoin mining company — one of the big ones. Since China’s 2021 crackdown, he’s been nomadic: Africa, Dubai, Northern Europe, Australia, the U.S. — chasing cheap energy and unstable regulation.</p>

  <p>With basic English, he speaks in kilowatts and capital now.<br>
  Sometimes I forget we once had long conversations after boarding school dinners — about everything and nothing.</p>

  <p>Now I’m tagging along. Skeptical of crypto, but intrigued — not so much by the currency, but by the culture it’s bred.</p>

  <p>What started as a casual “You should come” has become me checking into a hotel room overlooking The Sphere. It glows in the sunset — pulsing like an alien eye. Sometimes flashing emojis.<br>
  Ridiculous.<br>
  Impressive.<br>
  Like everything in this city.</p>

  <p>Bitcoin began as a whitepaper — decentralized, anti-authoritarian.<br>
  An idea.<br>
  A rebellion.<br>
  A response to the failures of 2008.<br>
  A wager that the individual could matter again.<br>
  A technological utopia aimed at the gray parts of humanity.</p>

  <p>Inside the Venetian, the conference unfolds: part trade show, part rave, part media circus, part financial prophecy.<br>
  Suits everywhere.<br>
  High heels. High conviction.</p>

  <p>The crowd looks more business than anarchist.<br>
  JD Vance. Eric Trump. Even the so-called “Crypto Czar,” David Sacks.<br>
  Czar — aren’t we in a democracy?</p>

  <p>The ideology has shifted — or maybe it’s always worn different masks.</p>

  <p>My friend Y, a coworker, came too — partly for Vegas, partly for the spectacle. Watching the buzz of sponsorships and side deals, he says:<br>
  “Bitcoin and Vegas — seems like the right combination.”</p>

  <p>The glamour. The illusion of control. The constant gambling.<br>
  We think we come to play.<br>
  Really, we’re the ones being played.</p>

  <p>Later, we meet Y’s friend J for lunch — a well-mannered Chinese girl with big, sharp eyes. She talks probability like others talk sports. There’s something about her — a kind of calm precision, as if she knows where all the exits are. I get the sense she’s not here for the same reasons the rest of us are.</p>

  <p>PhD in Finance from Berkeley. She and Y met during a Morgan Stanley internship, back when paths seemed more linear.</p>

  <p>She didn’t stay in banking.<br>
  She moved to Vegas to play poker professionally.</p>

  <p>She doesn’t say much about why.<br>
  Over lunch, she mentions she has a tournament later that night — an eight-hour qualifier.</p>

  <p>J talks about slot machines and quant strategies with the same serene enthusiasm and detachment. I find myself listening too closely, trying to decode some hidden tokens.</p>

  <p>She reminds me of the white rabbit — not in appearance, but in effect. A signal in the noise.<br>
  Not leading me anywhere specific, just… away. Deeper. Into the strangeness of it all.</p>

  <p>She drops opinions about the best restaurants in town just enough to make you wonder what else she’s applying her mind to.<br>
  I guess sitting in an office writing code is easier for me — intellectually clean, almost boring inside a big corporation.<br>
  No bluffing required.</p>

  <p>At the after-party hosted by my high school friend’s company, I end up at a few circular booths with a mix of people.</p>

  <p>There’s a guy in his late twenties — born into money, now expanding his mining farm.<br>
  He’s planning to pivot into AI inference next. As the conversation evolves, we start talking about network latency, automated code generation, and so on.</p>

  <p>Next to him, a crypto bro straight from central casting — Southern drawl, bulging biceps — brags about his mining site in rural Texas. He boasts about his power rates. About how many megawatts he can “swing.”</p>

  <p>Across from me, a young Chinese guy in a slightly too-big suit — the tag still hanging from the sleeve — talks about exchange arbitrage.</p>

  <p>Next to him, a crew from Kazakhstan. They went to grad school in Shanghai.<br>
  They speak Mandarin, Russian, and English without hesitation.<br>
  The country enjoyed a big boom after China's crypto mining ban. Now the energy costs rise upon increased demand.</p>

  <p>Toward the end of the night, a few women join our table.<br>
  One turns out to be the wife of a hosting facility founder based in the Midwest.<br>
  She’s an adolescent counselor. Says she loves her job. Feels fulfilled. She helps people — and never has to worry about money.</p>

  <p>She’s exuberant.<br>
  Tells me how her 8-year-old son used his birthday money to buy Bitcoin.<br>
  She thinks it’s “cute,” like a rite of passage.</p>

  <p>I don’t ask her about the environmental cost.<br>
  Or the centralization of mining.<br>
  Or the irony of crypto as a libertarian tool now aligning with billionaire interests.<br>
  Not tonight.</p>

  <p>There’s something I can’t quite verbalize — the confidence, the mythology, the language of absolutes.<br>
  It claims to reject institutions, yet builds its own with even more opacity.<br>
  It markets freedom, but is bound by hardware supply chains, regulatory arbitrage, and the same old games of power.<br>
  We humans built this construct, this narrative — and now people believe.</p>

  <p>I came here unsure of what I was looking for — maybe connection, maybe contrast, maybe just a good story.<br>
  Maybe my own suppressed, hard-to-face desire.</p>

  <p>I leave with fragments.<br>
  Voices.<br>
  Faces.<br>
  Ideas dressed up as ideology.</p>

  <p>Vegas fades behind me the way it always does — fast, loud, and full of lights.</p>

  <p>In the distance, the Sphere still glows — artificial, absurd, and undeniable. Like belief itself.</p>

  <p>The plane lifts. I close the window shade.</p>

  <p>We are all, in some way, chasing something — autonomy, fortune, a sense of control, a purpose.<br>
  Or maybe just a story that makes the chase feel worth it.</p>

  <p>Maybe there are no exits. Just layers. And deeper games to play.</p>

  <p>And for now, I am still very lost.</p>
