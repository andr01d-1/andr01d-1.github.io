It’s a bright weekend afternoon.
A short flight.
All the shades are down.

The hot desert air creates turbulence as the 737 jolts, then glides toward the runway. The motion wakes me. I look out, nothing. All the shades are still down. The taxi to the gate is almost aggressive.

It’s like a miracle machine, this plane, jetting me into a parallel space.
I walk off.
Vegas.

I haven’t been here in years. I’m not even sure how I ended up back. Somewhere between nostalgia and a text from an old high school friend offering a pass to the largest Bitcoin conference of the year.

We haven’t really talked in over a decade. He had lived entirely in China until two or three years ago. Now he works for a Chinese ASIC Bitcoin mining company, one of the big ones. Since China’s 2021 crackdown, he’s been nomadic: Africa, Dubai, Northern Europe, Australia, the U.S. chasing cheap energy and shifting regulations.

With basic English, he speaks in kilowatts and capital now.
Sometimes I forget we once had long conversations after boarding school dinners about everything and nothing.

Now I’m tagging along. Skeptical of crypto, but intrigued, not so much by the currency, but by the culture it has bred.

What started as a casual “You should come” has become my checking into a hotel room overlooking The Sphere. It glows in the sunset, pulsing like an alien eye. Sometimes flashing emojis.
Ridiculous.
Impressive.
Like everything in this city.

Bitcoin began as a whitepaper, decentralized, anti-authoritarian.
An idea.
A rebellion.
A response to the failures of 2008.
A wager that the individual could matter again.
A technological utopia aimed at the gray parts of humanity.

Inside the Venetian, the conference unfolds: part trade show, part rave, part media circus, part financial prophecy.
Suits everywhere.
High heels. High conviction.

The crowd looks more business than anarchist.
JD Vance. Eric Trump. Even the so-called “Crypto Czar,” David Sacks.
Czar, aren’t we in a democracy?

The ideology has shifted or maybe it’s always worn different masks.

My friend Y, a coworker, came too, partly for Vegas, partly for the spectacle. Watching the buzz of sponsorships and side deals, he says:
“Bitcoin and Vegas, seems like the right combination.”

The glamour. The illusion of control. The constant gambling.
We think we come to play.
Really, we’re the ones being played.

Later, we meet Y’s friend J at a restaurant, a well-mannered Chinese girl with big, sharp eyes. She talks probability like others talk sports. There’s something about her, a kind of calm precision. She has a PhD in Finance from Berkeley. She and Y met during a Morgan Stanley internship, back when paths seemed more linear.

She didn’t stay in investment banking.
She moved to Vegas to play poker professionally.

She doesn’t say much about why.
Over lunch, she mentions she has a tournament later that night, an eight-hour qualifier.

J talks about slot machines and quant strategies with the same serene enthusiasm, and detachment. I find myself listening too closely, trying to decode hidden tokens.

She reminds me of the white rabbit, not only in appearance, but also in effect. A signal in the noise.
Not leading me anywhere specific, just… away. Deeper. Into the strangeness of it all.

There’s a feeling I can’t shake something about her feels untethered. She drops opinions about the best restaurants in town just enough to make you wonder what else she’s applying her mind to. I guess sitting in an office writing code is easier for me intellectually clean, almost boring inside a big corporation.
No bluffing required, at least that's what I believed.

At the after-party hosted by my high school friend’s company, I end up at a few tables with a mix of people.

There’s a guy in his late twenties, born into money, now expanding his mining farm.
He’s planning to pivot into AI inference next. As the conversation evolves, we start talking about network latency, automated code generation, and so on.

Next to him, a crypto bro straight from central casting, Southern drawl, bulging biceps, brags about his mining site in west Texas. He boasts about his power rates. About how many megawatts he can “swing.”

Across from me, a young Chinese guy in a slightly too-big suit, the tag still hanging from the sleeve, talks about bitcoin exchange he works for.

Next to him, a crew from Kazakhstan. They went to grad school in Shanghai.
They speak Mandarin, Russian, and English without hesitation.
The country enjoyed a boom after China’s crypto mining ban. Now, the country's coal burning energy costs are rising with demand.

Toward the end of the night, a few women join our table.
One turns out to be the wife of a hosting facility founder based in the Midwest.
She’s an adolescent counselor. Says she loves her job. Feels fulfilled. She helps people and never has to worry about money.

She’s exuberant.
Tells me how her 8 year old son used his birthday money to buy Bitcoin.
She thinks it’s “cute,” like a rite of passage.

I don’t ask her about the environmental cost.
Or the centralization of mining.
Or the irony of crypto as a libertarian tool now aligning with billionaire interests.
Not tonight.

There’s something I can’t quite verbalize, the confidence, the mythology, the language of absolutes.
It claims to reject institutions, yet builds its own with even more opacity.
It markets freedom, but is bound by hardware supply chains, regulatory arbitrage, and the same old games of power.
We humans built this construct, this narrative and now people believe.

I came here unsure of what I was looking for, maybe connection, maybe contrast, maybe just a story.
Maybe my own suppressed, hard-to-face desire.

I leave with fragments.
Voices.
Faces.
Ideas dressed up as ideology.

Vegas fades behind me the way it always does, fast, loud, and full of lights.

In the distance, the Sphere still glows, artificial, absurd, and undeniable. Like belief itself.

The plane lifts. I close the window shade.

We are all, in some way, chasing something, autonomy, fortune, a sense of control, a purpose.
Or maybe just a story that makes the chase feel worth it.

Maybe there are no exits. Just layers and deeper games to play.

And for now, I am still very lost.
